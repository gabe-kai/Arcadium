# Cursor AI Rules for Arcadium Project

## Wiki Content Writing

**When asked to write wiki pages or content:**

1. Always refer to `docs/wiki-ai-content-management.md` for complete instructions
2. Write markdown files with YAML frontmatter to `services/wiki/data/pages/`
3. Use `parent_slug` (not `parent_id`) in frontmatter
4. Always set `created_by: "admin"` and `updated_by: "admin"`
5. After writing files, remind user to run: `python -m app.sync sync-all`

See `docs/wiki-ai-content-management.md` for the Quick Reference guide and full details.
