# Welcome to Arcadium

Arcadium is a large-scale, living game world that combines deep systems design, rich lore, and a collaborative development process. This project brings together a dedicated game server, a browser-based client, and a documentation-first wiki to keep everything coherent as the world grows.

## What this wiki is for

The Arcadium Wiki is the **single source of truth** for:

- High-level game design and worldbuilding
- Technical architecture of the services that power the game
- Operational runbooks, admin tools, and workflows

Everything from combat mechanics to deployment checklists will eventually live here.

## Where to start

If you are new to the project, start by reading the high-level overview pages in the **Introduction** section, then dive into the game design and architecture areas that match your role (design, engineering, operations, or content).
