This page will contain information about Non-Player Characters (NPCs) in Arcadium.

## Overview

NPCs are autonomous entities in the Arcadium world that have their own needs, behaviors, and resource requirements. Each NPC type has distinct characteristics and survival requirements.

## NPC Types

### Human

Humans are the most complex NPC type, requiring multiple resources to maintain their well-being.

**Basic Needs:**
- Sustenance (food and water)
- Shelter (protection from elements)
- Social interaction (community and communication)
- Safety (security and protection)

**Resource Types:**
- Food resources (meat, vegetables, grains, prepared meals)
- Water resources (clean water, beverages)
- Building materials (wood, stone, metal for construction)
- Tools and equipment (for crafting and maintenance)
- Currency (for trade and economic interactions)

#### Human NPC Character Sheet

Human NPCs track their needs using a character sheet system similar to The Sims, where each need is measured on a scale from 0-100. Needs decay over time and must be fulfilled through various activities and resources.

**Core Needs:**

| Need | Description | Decay Rate | Fulfilled By |
|------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **Hunger** | The NPC's need for food | Moderate | Eating meals, snacks, consuming food resources |
| **Thirst** | The NPC's need for water | Fast | Drinking water, beverages, consuming water resources |
| **Energy** | The NPC's physical and mental stamina | Moderate | Sleeping, resting, consuming stimulants |
| **Hygiene** | The NPC's cleanliness and health | Slow | Bathing, washing, using hygiene resources |
| **Bladder** | The NPC's need to relieve themselves | Moderate | Using restroom facilities |
| **Fun** | The NPC's need for entertainment and enjoyment | Slow | Games, hobbies, entertainment activities |
| **Social** | The NPC's need for interaction with others | Slow | Conversations, group activities, social events |
| **Comfort** | The NPC's physical comfort level | Slow | Quality furniture, comfortable environments, rest |
| **Environment** | The NPC's satisfaction with their surroundings | Very Slow | Well-maintained spaces, aesthetics, safety |

**Need Levels:**
- **0-20**: Critical - NPC will prioritize fulfilling this need above all else
- **21-40**: Low - NPC will seek to fulfill this need soon
- **41-60**: Moderate - NPC is content but will address if opportunity arises
- **61-80**: Good - NPC is satisfied
- **81-100**: Excellent - NPC is very satisfied and may engage in optional activities

**Need Interactions:**
- Low needs can negatively impact other needs (e.g., low Energy reduces effectiveness of all activities)
- Some needs can be fulfilled simultaneously (e.g., Social + Fun through group activities)
- Critical needs may cause NPCs to abandon current tasks to address them

### Animal

Animals are simpler NPCs that focus primarily on survival and instinctual behaviors.

**Basic Needs:**
- Sustenance (food and water)
- Shelter (nesting areas, burrows, or natural cover)
- Territory (space for hunting, foraging, or grazing)
- Reproduction (mating and offspring care)

**Resource Types:**
- Food resources (prey, plants, carrion, feed)
- Water resources (natural water sources)
- Natural materials (grass, leaves, branches for nesting)
- Territory markers (scent, visual markers)

### Robot

Robots are mechanical NPCs that require energy and maintenance rather than biological sustenance.

**Basic Needs:**
- Power (energy to function)
- Maintenance (repairs and component replacement)
- Programming updates (software and behavioral updates)
- Materials (raw materials for construction and repair)

**Resource Types:**
- Energy resources (batteries, fuel cells, power cores)
- Mechanical components (gears, circuits, actuators)
- Raw materials (metal, plastic, electronic components)
- Data resources (information, protocols, updates)
